You simply cannot understand this language!
It keeps your brain from working anymore, like it's burnt out.

The name of the language is composed of "move" and "repeat"."move" and "repeat" are two core commands in MR language.

MR language is inspired by [brainfuck](http://www.muppetlabs.com/~breadbox/bf/).
